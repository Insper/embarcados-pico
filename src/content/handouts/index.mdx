**Active Handout** is a tool to create online course materials. It's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for authoring and [GitHub](https://github.com) for publishing.

Besides publishing materials, **Active Handout** also allows the addition of some interactive contents that enhance students' learning.

  telemetry enabled, it should record and fetch the exercise state (done or not)
  from Firebase.
